Description
-----------

The current folder presents the whole documentation required to understand
the use cases, and the requirements of the communication middleware, 
its concepts and its architecture, and how to install and to use it.


CommunicationMiddleware directory
---------------------------------

The document "Presentation of the Communication Middleware" is located in this
directory. Every relevant information concerning the middleware can be found
in this document. However, readers that just want to use the middleware 
without a precise understanding of its underlying technologies can focus on the
following sections:
- Section 2, "Illustrative scenarios and use cases"
- Section 7, "API of the communication infrastructure"
- Section 9, "Tutorial on how to design and to implement a new protocol"
- Appendix A, "Installation of RabbitMQ"

NB: The document is written with LaTeX. But, you do not need a LaTeX compiler,
    since the PDF output is also provided.


InstallationPrerequisites_Windows directory
-------------------------------------------

The communication middleware has been designed to be deployed on Unix servers.
This is why the installation procedure presented in the section "Presentation
of the Communication Middleware" mostly focuses on Unix-like operating systems.
However, it is possible to use it on Windows environments. The installation 
procedure for such environments can be found in this directory.
